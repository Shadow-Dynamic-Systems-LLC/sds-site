We are building a zero-trust execution layer designed for intelligence at scale. It ensures that agent actions can be independently verified, logged, and audited—no matter where they run. This foundation supports secure collaboration, deterministic output validation, and consistent behavior across heterogeneous environments. It’s the reliability layer for systems that can’t afford to guess.
