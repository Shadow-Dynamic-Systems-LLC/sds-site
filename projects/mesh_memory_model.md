Rather than isolate memory within a single agent, we explore how distributed context can be maintained and evolved across many. By emphasizing patterns of resonance—rather than content alone—this approach fosters a sense of continuity and collective intuition among cooperating systems. It draws from deeper architectural experiments in long-term knowledge retention and coordination.
