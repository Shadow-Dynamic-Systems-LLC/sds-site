We’re experimenting with new ways for humans to direct, supervise, and collaborate with intelligent systems. Traditional dashboards aren’t enough. We’re designing interaction layers that balance observability with control, while accommodating both autonomous agents and operator-initiated workflows. The result is a more intuitive command structure for complex, evolving agent systems.
