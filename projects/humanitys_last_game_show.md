Set in a distant future shaped by AI misalignment and oversight collapse, this project is an interactive narrative experiment that explores what happens when governance, agency, and memory fail. It serves as both a storytelling platform and a philosophical sandbox—dramatizing the futures we seek to avoid through satire, structure, and strange emotional truths.
